Welcome to Uni10, the Universal Tensor Network Library. 

Uni10 is programmed in C++ and designed with the applications to the tensor 
network algorithms, such TEBD, PEPS and MERA in mind. We hope the availability 
of Uni10 will make future implementation of tensor network algorithms much 
easier and less error prone.
